# ROS1Noetic-TurtleBot3-Gazebo-Autonomous_Navigation-Speed-Sign-Recognition-YOLO
This project uses ROS Noetic on Ubuntu 20.04 to simulate a TurtleBot3 autonomously navigating a custom Gazebo map with predefined waypoints. The robot detects speed limit signs using a YOLOv8 model trained on Google Colab and adjusts its speed accordingly. Speed signs are mixed with other objects to test detection accuracy.
